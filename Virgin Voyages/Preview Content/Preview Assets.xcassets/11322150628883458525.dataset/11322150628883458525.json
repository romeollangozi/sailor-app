After a drive through the Swakop River Valley, you&rsquo;ll stop at the breathtaking Moon Landscape, where spectacular rock formations give the area an appearance similar to the moon&rsquo;s surface. Next, you&rsquo;ll visit the Welwitschia Valley and enjoy a light lunch at Goanikontes Oasis, an actual green paradise in the desert. Then you&rsquo;ll return home via the coastal road, with dunes on one side, ocean on the other.","imageUrl":"https://cms.res.virginvoyages.com/dam/jcr:3954d0c4-d3ba-48bb-a824-5ff2f8c6eeff/IMG-DEST-WALVIS%20BAY-NAMIBIA-Traverse-the-Treasures-of-The-Namib-by-4x4-408448946-1200x800.jpg","amount":155,"startTime":"2024-04-19T12:30:00","currencyCode":"USD","activityCode":"WVBDRV00003","activitySlots":[{"activitySlotCode":"RS-WVBDRV3-1","activitySellingPrices":[{"ageGroup":{"maxRange":99,"minRange":0},"amount":155,"levelType":"ALL","levelValue":"ALL","personType":"G"}],"duration":270,"endDate":"2024-04-19T17:00:00","isEnabled":true,"isInventoryAvailable":false,"inventoryCount":0,"meetingTime":"","startDate":"2024-04-19T12:30:00","deckLocation":"Walvis Bay","isBookingClosed":false,"isHideEndTime":false}],"portCode":"WVB","isBookingEnabled":true,"isAvailable":false,"isFavourite":false,"isNotifyEnabled":false,"isSubscribed":false,"tags":"CULTURED","subTypeId":"CULTURED","guestDetails":[],"activityLevel":"EASY","mobileHighlightImageUrl":"https://cms.res.virginvoyages.com/dam/jcr:177a6db3-9d3a-4524-a544-8dee396889f8/IMG-DEST-WALVIS%20BAY-NAMIBIA-Traverse-the-Treasures-of-The-Namib-by-4x4-408448946-750x1000.jpg","tabletHighlightImageUrl":"https://cms.res.virginvoyages.com/dam/jcr:3954d0c4-d3ba-48bb-a824-5ff2f8c6eeff/IMG-DEST-WALVIS%20BAY-NAMIBIA-Traverse-the-Treasures-of-The-Namib-by-4x4-408448946-1200x800.jpg","highlightDetails":["1-hour return drive along coastal road","Light lunch at Goanikontes Oasis","View local plant life in the Welwitschia Valley","Stop at Moon Landscape for breathtaking views","1-hour 4x4 drive to Namib-Naukluft Park"],"introduction":"Get your heart pumping with this 4x4 tour of Namib-Naukluft Park, where high-shifting dunes give way to a kaleidoscope of colors and plantlife.","instructionDetails":["Off-road portion may be bumpy.
