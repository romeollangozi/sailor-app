And located over at The Social Club Bar, we offer signature drinks and treats like our photogenic freak milkshake and floats stacked high with cookies, cake, frosting and candy &mdash; with an option to spike them with a lil booze for an adult-friendly upgrade.","dividerColor":"f7f7f7","needToKnowsColor":"6E6E6E","featuredEventsCategoryCode":"ET","virtualQueuesBackgroundImage":"https://cdn.speedsize.com/eb8d0010-7300-4129-8a6d-74bc221f9caf/https://www.virginvoyages.com/dam/jcr:e2a9db13-cb75-4d19-8b89-01564c5e6c7f/IMG-FNB-the-social-club-architectural-main-v1-01-0015-1200x1920.jpg","featuredEvents":[],"bannerBgColor":"f7f7f7","bannerTextColor":"191919","categoryCode":"RT","isFavourite":false,"spaceCurrentStatus":{"label":"Opening times"},"operationalHours":[{"fromDate":"Friday","toDate":"Thursday","fromTime":"2:00pm","toTime":"4:30pm"},{"fromDate":"Friday","toDate":"Thursday","fromTime":"5:30pm","toTime":"10:00pm"},{"fromDate":"Saturday","toDate":"Thursday","fromTime":"4:00pm","toTime":"12:00am"},{"fromDate":"Sunday","toDate":"Thursday","fromTime":"4:00pm","toTime":"12:00am"},{"fromDate":"Monday","toDate":"Thursday","fromTime":"1:00pm","toTime":"12:00am"}],"openingTimes":[{"label":"Friday","text":"2:00pm -
